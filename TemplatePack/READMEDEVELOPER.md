**Note:** If you use this API add this file to your pack.

Once you have read this file you can delete, mostly to inform the dev about this API License If you use this datapack as a API/Dependecy let me (Legopitstop) know that way I can help make sure eveything is working as intend. If you have an idea for this API feel free to contact. I promise I don't bite, well... unless your made of candy. Also note their may be changes with this API that will/may require some changes, so make sure you keep tabs on the API and any API changes. If you plan on not updating with this API make sure to note what version of the API it uses. https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/legopitstops-recipe-core-datapack

Custom API License:
* Do Not Include the API pack (template you can) inside your datapack, users must download the API seperatly ONLY from any of Legopitstop's most used sites. If you want the API inside your pack contact Legopitstop first before doing so.
* Do Not hoast the API pack yourself. The user must visit one of Legopitstop's upload sites to download the API.
* Do Not use Lot's More Food's custom table models, Those are copy righted to that pack, This will immediently break the License agreement!
* You MUST keep the "READ ME API.rtf" file inside and easly visable within your pack(s)
* You may use an Ad-Link shortener (like ad.fly, adfoc.us, etc) to direct users to download the API from any of legopitstop websites.
* Feel free to use the template inside your pack.
* Feel free to use the Google Sheet to help create your pack. I recomend coping/downloading the Google Sheet this way no one can mess-up your code or break the generator. Also check for updates https://legopitstop.weebly.com/tools.html
